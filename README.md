Create a multi-page, responsive site using bootstrap.


### HW 2 â€“ Mult-Page Boostrap Portfolio Page

I created a portfolio page with some of my previous design work featured as well as some personal information about myself.I also wanted to show some of my personality in color choices and type choices.

The entire layout is created for bootstrap framework and light use of media queries to create a layout that will work on all screen sizes.


### Impressions

I was taught to write CSS from scratch and have spent more time tweaking and problem solving than writing actual code and making layouts. Coming in and learning that there are bootstrap frameworks in place that can create layouts within minutes is definitley an eye opener. 

After experimenting and trying out some bootstrap components it really makes me want to explore the library more and try to build larger, more complex pages!
